I have used the user based collaborative filtering approach for this project

#### Project Dependencies

#### To execute the project make sure the requirements are satisfied as per your system

First clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/paritoshshirodkar/Movie-Recommendation-System-Using-Stacked-Autoencoders

If the command line alternative does not work I recommend using the Spyder IDE which can be downloaded from the following link
